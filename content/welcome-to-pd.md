# Welcome to Pd

You can reach the Pd mailing list for help, please subscribe to
the [pd-list](https://lists.iem.at/hyperkitty/list/pd-list@lists.iem.at/).
It is perfectly reasonable to post "beginner" questions there.

There is a very extensive Pd community web site, 
[puredata.info](https://puredata.info/), which aims to be
the central resource for Pd, from documentation and downloads;
to forums, member pages, and a patch exchange. A link to it
is also available in the Help Menu.

You can read the [Pd Manual](https://msp.puredata.info/Pd_documentation/index.htm) for more details on running and configuring Pd, this is also available in the **Help/Manual** menu.

**Help/Browser** will give you access to documentation resources
under the 'Pure Data' tab. You'll also find the manual there as
well as examples/tutorials.

**Help/List of objects** opens a patch with all [native objects](../objects/) in
Pure Data. You can right click on each object for help on how
each object works.

If you find a bug, please report it on our [issue tracker](https://bugs.puredata.info),
a link to it also available in the Help Menu.

Finally, you can use the Help menu to [find and install externals](https://deken.puredata.info),
for more details on how to do that, please refer to [chapter 4](https://msp.ucsd.edu/Pd_documentation/resources/chapter4.htm)
of Pd's manual.
