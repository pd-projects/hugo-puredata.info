## Welcome to Pd

You can reach the Pd mailing list for help, please subscribe to 
the [pd-list](https://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pd-list). 
It is perfectly reasonable to post "beginner" questions there. 

There is a very extensive Pd community web site, 
[pure-data.info](http://www.pure-data.info/), which aims to be 
the central resource for Pd, from documentation and downloads; 
to forums, member pages, and a patch exchange. A link to it 
is also available in the Help Menu.

You can read the Pd Manual for more details on running and configuring 
Pd <http://msp.ucsd.edu/Pd_documentation/index.htm>, this is also 
available in the Help/Manual menu.

**Help/Browser** will give you access to documentation resources 
under the 'Pure Data' tab. You'll also find the manual there as 
well as examples/tutorials.

**Help/List of objects** opens a patch with all native objects in 
Pure Data. You can right click on each object for help on how 
each object works.

If you find a bug, please report it on github, a link to it also 
available in the Help Menu.

Finally, you can use the Help menu to find and install externals, 
for more details on how to do that, please refer to chapter 4 
of Pd's manual.
