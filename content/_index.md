# Pure Data

Pure Data is an open source visual programming environment that runs on anything from
personal computers to embedded devices (ie Raspberry Pi) and smartphones 
(via [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/libpd), 
[DroidParty](https://droidparty.net/)(Android), and 
[PdParty](http://danomatika.com/code/pdparty)(iOS). 
It is a major branch of the family of patcher programming languages known as
Max (Max/FTS, ISPW Max, [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/), etc), originally developed by
Miller Puckette at [IRCAM](http://www.ircam.fr/).

Pd enables musicians, visual artists, performers, researchers, and developers to create 
software graphically without writing lines of code. Pd can be used to process and generate
sound, video, 2D/3D graphics, and interface sensors, input devices, and MIDI. Pd can easily
work over local and remote networks to integrate wearable technology, motor systems, 
lighting rigs, and other equipment. It is suitable for learning basic multimedia processing
and visual programming methods as well as for realizing complex systems for large-scale 
projects.

Algorithmic functions are represented in Pd by visual boxes called **objects** placed within
a patching window called a **canvas**. Data flow between objects are achieved through 
visual connections called **patch cords**. Each object performs a specific task, which can
vary in complexity from very low-level mathematical operations to complicated audio or
video functions such as reverberation, FFT transformations, or video decoding. Objects 
include core Pd vanilla objects, external objects or **externals** (Pd objects compiled 
from C or C++), and **abstractions** (Pd patches loaded as objects).
